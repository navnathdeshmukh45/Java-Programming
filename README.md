# Comments in Java

Comments in Java are used to provide explanations or documentation within the source code. They are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the execution of the program. There are two types of comments in Java: single-line comments and multi-line comments.
1. This is a single-line comment 
`int number = 10; // Assigning value to a variable`
2. Multi-line comments:
```
/*
 * This is a multi-line comment.
 * It can span multiple lines.
 * This is often used for documentation or explanations.
 */
```
